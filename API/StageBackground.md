# StageBackground

**Inherits:** ParallaxBackground

This is the base holder for anything with parallax.

[](../notice.md ':include')

## Description

The StageBackground class is a simple addon to the ParallaxBackground that allows it to be used properly with the stage loader's capabilities.
Not much new comes with this extension, just some properties specific to the loader.

StageBackgrounds are typically the holders for StageLayers, which perform the actual parallax and layering action. 
The backgrounds handle the busywork like scrolling and whatnot, while the layers hold values for scroll factors and other
parallax related properties.

To see a basic example on how to use this object, see [Getting Started](beginners.md).

## Properties
