# API Reference

Here you'll find the notes on the Custom Stage Loader's API. 

----

The Custom Stage API is built so that going above and beyond is not only encouraged -- it's the *norm.* Because of this, there's a lot to cover. 
See *[Getting Started](beginners.md)* for information on how to use the Custom Stage Loader and its API.

?> Documentation is *typically* up to date, but please let us know if you run into an outdated piece of information. We're trying our best.
